- the connector around `is_terminal(batch_id)` + `atomic_copy` (so its mirror cannot
  resurrect a freshly-finalized batch);
- the `callback-processor` daemon for each event drained from the SDK queue (so it
  observes `clord_index` only after the in-flight cycle commits — no race-drop of
  events for orders we just submitted). The SDK callback functions themselves only
  snapshot + enqueue; they never touch this lock;
- `order_log.move_pair` / `move_invalid` (cross-directory moves);
- `order_log.append` / `replay_record` / `locate_record` (path lookups must agree
  with whichever directory currently owns the batch).

Reentrant so the cycle can call into `order_log` helpers while already holding it.
